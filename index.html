        <h1>CHICKS BIRTH</h1>
        <p>If hatching naturally, the mother hen will sit on the eggs to maintain the optimum temperature so they can develop until it is almost hatching time. Sometimes hens won’t take to sitting on their eggs, and so you may need to purchase an incubator and do this step yourself. We have plenty of incubating articles on our learning centre should you need to take over the role of mother hen! The chick inside the egg will generally grow for 21 days, using the egg yolk as a means of nutrition as it grows. Along with sitting on the eggs, the hen will also use her beak to turn them to aid their development.
            On about day 19 of the incubation period, the chicks will begin the pipping process. This involves the baby chick using their ‘egg tooth’ to peck a hole in the eggshell around the air sac to access oxygen, before pipping an area large enough for it to be free of its shell. This process can take up to 24 hours and should not be rushed.</p>

      <h1>CHICKENS</h1>
        <p>Younger hens are known as pullets and may be ready to lay as young as 18 weeks, however this will vary between breeds. All birds tend to come into lay earlier during periods of increasing sunlight, or later if they reach maturity in early winter.
            A healthy and productive female hen will lay eggs until they are about 72 weeks old, however this will also depend on the period of their first moult.As hens get older, they will start showing signs of their age. A wrinkled and dull face, heavy eyes, increasing rear size, and lack of energy are all possible indications that a chicken is approaching old age. Despite this, they will still remain the delightful creatures they once were through to their very last days.

        <h1>GROWTH RATE OF HENS</h1>
        <p>Conventionally bred broiler chickens: Most of the chicken available in the stores today comes from flocks that grow to market weight in about 48 days on average, using fewer natural resources – therefore more sustainably. Compared to 25 years ago, today’s chickens now require seven percent less feed per pound to grow. Considering our national broiler flock eats about 57 million tons of feed per year – that is a lot of resources saved.</p>

        <h1>Poultry farming</h1>
        <p>'Poultry farming is the form of animal husbandry which raises domesticated birds such as chickens, ducks, turkeys and geese to produce meat or eggs for food. Poultry – mostly chickens – are farmed in great numbers. More than 60 billion chickens are killed for consumption annually.[2][3] Chickens raised for eggs are known as layers, while chickens raised for meat are called broilers</p>

       <h1>FACTS ABOUT HENS</h1>
        <p>
            51.4 billion chickens are artificially hatched, fattened up and slaughtered as 42-day-old babies every year globally. A chicken’s normal lifespan is 10–15 years. Chickens and turkeys together represent 99% of land animals slaughtered for food in the United States.Chickens bred for meat are arguably the most genetically manipulated of all animals, forced to grow 65 times faster than their bodies normally would, and the industry continually seeks to increase their growth rate.
